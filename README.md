###Flyingpiranhas MVC

####Introduction
The FlyingPiranhas mvc library is part of the [FlyingPiranhas](http://www.flyingpiranhas.net) wireframework. It helps [me](http://www.bitfalls.com) develop websites quickly and safely, so I thought I'd share it with the world. For more information on it and its authors, head over to the home page and read up.

####MVC
This is the _mvc_ library, meaning it allows you to get up an running with a robust MVC setup in next to no time. The library is designed to work out of the box, so you can start working as soon as you run "composer install". The classes are designed to leave a truly minimal footprint on your application, so give them a go.

####Requirements
- Php 5.4+
- Flyingpiranhas Common

####Installation
The recommended way is to install through composer. Find the package on Packagist.org, and follow instructions.

####License
See LICENSE.md

####Contributing
There's a lot of @todos in the code, so feel free to take a look and submit a pull request if you fix anything. Also, we desperately need tests written. There's a few of them to serve as an example in the tests/ subfolder, so if you could contribute that'd be swell. There is only one rule: follow PSR-2 as much as possible. Use other classes as examples and keep the coding style consistent.
